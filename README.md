# A Collaborative Todo Sample

This project is a collaborative todo app built with [tRPC](https://trpc.io], [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Next-Auth](nextauth.org), and [ZenStack](https://zenstack.dev).

In this fictitious app, users can be invited to workspaces where they can collaborate on todos. Public todo lists are visible to all members in the workspace.

See a live deployment at: https://zenstack-todo.vercel.app/.
